I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [Robotics Institute, CMU](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/) where I contribute to the [NSF AI-CARING Institute](https://www.ai-caring.org/). I have a Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) from [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/), where I was part of the [People and Robots Lab](https://peopleandrobots.wisc.edu/).

I design and build intelligent, interactive systems that **support collaboration in group settings**. My current focus is on small group settings, such as teams, families, and classrooms, where individuals often bring different goals, abilities, or constraints. These differences make collaboration powerful, but they can also create miscommunication, inefficiency, and conflict. Using a human-centered approach, I develop robotic and AI systems that mediate these differences to improve collective outcomes, while respecting human diversity. 

My **teaching and mentoring** is guided by the belief that computer science education should prepare students to integrate technical expertise with the analytical, creative, and collaborative skills needed to succeed in a rapidly evolving landscape shaped by automation and AI. I put this into practice by teaching technical knowledge in ways that emphasize human-centered computing, design thinking, and collaborative learning.

Prior to joining graduate school, I was a junior research scientist for two years at [Xerox Research Center India](https://www.news.conduent.com/news/Xerox-expands-healthcare-research-at-hospitals-with-remote-sensing) where I built algorithms for monitoring a personâ€™s breathing using webcams [(see video).](https://youtu.be/a7BPu4mUKaY) I have a B.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras.](https://www.iitm.ac.in/)
